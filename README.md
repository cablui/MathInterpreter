This is a C# console application based on the "Math Interpreter" exercise from Harvardâ€™s CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python.
In this version, I reimplemented the original Python logic using C#, building a simple interpreter that evaluates basic arithmetic expressions entered by the user.

The program takes input in the format:
x y z

Where:
1. x and z are integers;
2. y is an operator: +, -, *, or /;
3. The expression must include spaces between each element (e.g., 4 * 5);
4. The result is output as a floating-point number formatted to one decimal place;
5. Division by zero is not allowed;
6. This project was a great exercise in parsing input, handling basic math operations, and formatting output in C#.
